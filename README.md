# ☁️ Weather Data Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of weather data using **Python**. The objective is to analyze historical weather patterns, temperature trends, and climatic conditions to gain insights into seasonal variations and extreme weather events.  

## 📊 Key Insights & Analysis  
- **Temperature Trends**: Analyzing average, maximum, and minimum temperatures over time.  
- **Rainfall & Humidity Patterns**: Identifying seasonal variations in precipitation and humidity levels.  
- **Extreme Weather Events**: Detecting heatwaves, cold waves, and heavy rainfall patterns.  
- **Wind Speed Analysis**: Studying wind variations and their impact on weather conditions.  
- **Correlation Between Variables**: Understanding how temperature, humidity, and pressure interact.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**: Data processing and visualization  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and reporting  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset contains:  
- Date & time information  
- Temperature (max, min, average)  
- Humidity & pressure levels  
- Rainfall & snowfall data  
- Wind speed & direction  

## 🚀 Steps in Analysis  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using visualization techniques to find patterns.  
3. **Seasonal Trends Analysis**: Identifying recurring weather patterns.  
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding correlations and outliers.  

## 📷 Sample Visualizations  
*(Include screenshots of visualizations, e.g., temperature distribution, rainfall trends, etc.)*  

## 📢 Conclusion  
This analysis provides valuable insights into **weather trends, seasonal patterns, and extreme climate conditions**. Such insights can be useful for **climate researchers, policymakers, and businesses** to prepare for weather fluctuations.
